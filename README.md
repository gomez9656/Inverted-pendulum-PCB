# Inverted-pendulum-PCB
PCB for an inverted pendulum, one layer.

In my college, I had the opportunity to participate in the design of a PCB for an inverted pendulum that used PID control. 

The pendulum used an Arduino Mega that controlled the motors, and my job was to design a PCB shield for the Arduino Mega, so it can be able to fulfill other hardware requirements. I also did a lot of reverse engineering because there were no schematics of the circuit that was working on the pendulum. so it was a very good experience.

I prototyped the PCB shield using an SRM-20 GNC machine, as you can see in the images, the PCB has a lot of components and traces, and I had the requirements to do this in only one layer, so in this way, I can build the prototype very fast using the SRM-20.

In the file section, you can see an image of the board. It is very poor welded(it was my first big project). I was able to prototype it very fast using the Excellon_Gcode, which you can check on my Excellen_Gcode repository.

Don't hesitate to ask me anything if you are looking to do something similar.
