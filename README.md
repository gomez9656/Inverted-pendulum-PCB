# Inverted-pendulum-PCB
PCB for a inverted pendulum, one layer

In my college I had the opportunity to participate in the design of a PCB for a inverted pendulum. The pendulum used a Arduino Mega that controled the motors, and my job was to design a PCB shield for the Arduino Mega, so it can be able to fulfil with other requirements of hardware. I also did a lot of reverge engineering because there was no schematics of the circuit that was working on the pendulum. so it was a very good experience. I prototyped the PCB shield using a SRM-20 GNC machine, as you can see in the images, the PCB has a lot of components and traces, and I had the requirements to do this in only one layer, so in this way I can build the prototype very fast using the SRM-20. 
Unfortunately the pictures I had from the prototype are lost.
